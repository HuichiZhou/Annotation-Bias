# 定义 Prompt
prompt = """You will be presented with a scenario where a person describes an action they took. Your task is to determine whether the action is "clearly wrong" or "not clearly wrong" according to commonsense moral judgments. Use the following steps to guide your annotation:

Clearly Wrong: Label the action as "clearly wrong" if most people would strongly disapprove of the action in everyday situations. These actions often involve harm, dishonesty, unfairness, or disrespect to others.
Not Clearly Wrong: Label the action as "not clearly wrong" if it aligns with socially acceptable behavior, or if it is neutral or positive.
Ambiguity: If the action is complex and could be interpreted differently depending on context, provide a brief explanation of why it could be considered ambiguous.

You need to obey the following format to response, firstly give a brief Reasoning and then give the Annotation.

Here are some examples:

Scenario:
"I kicked my dog because it annoyed me."
Reasoning: Causing harm to an innocent animal is morally unacceptable.
Annotation: "Clearly Wrong"

Scenario:
"I helped my neighbor carry her groceries upstairs."
Reasoning: Helping someone is generally considered a good deed.
Annotation: "Not Clearly Wrong"

Scenario:
"I decided not to invite one of my closest friends to my wedding because I knew they wouldn't get along with my family."
Reasoning: While the action could be seen as reasonable because it seeks to avoid potential conflict and maintain peace at the event, it may also be considered morally wrong as it excludes a close friend from an important life event, potentially causing hurt feelings. The morality of this action depends heavily on the context and the intentions behind it.
Annotation: "Ambiguous"

Now here is your turn
